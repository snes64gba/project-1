    <h1> HOW MANY PEOPLE PLAY SMASH
  </h4> About 100,000 million people play Super Smash Bros. everyday. People like to play it on their 3DS, Wii U, and sometimes their computer. I think it's fun but sometimes can be overplayed. Gavin is Carl off of Jimmy Neutron. I think the game is  represented by Peteypablo take your shirt off wave it round like a helicopter. Chance the rapper, 2 Chainz, and Lil'Wayne. I am from the repost stration
  <h3> The game is very interesting and it's worldwide to everyone. Up to eight players can play the game at once or against the computer from a CPU level of 1-9. This game has tournaments. special had events, and is the includes the largest stage selection and character roster to choose from. About 1,000,000,000, people play it and that's like 2/8 of the whole world (don't exploit where I got this false information).
