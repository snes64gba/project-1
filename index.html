<h4> SUPER SMASH BROS. FOR WII U
  <p> Super Smash Bros. for Wii U is the fourth installment of the SSB Series for Wii U. The game allows you to fight, train your character and fight the enemy. Pretty soon you'll be wanting to launch the gamepad out your window and scream as loud as possible until your parents say it's over. The game consists of 58 characters (7 which are downloadable) and 55 stages (6 of which are unlockable). The game was released on September 3, 2014, and is still an enjoyable game to play.</p>
<h4> WHY THE GAME IS SO FUN
  <p> Fighting the enemy, and players online is just incredible, and the gameplay is really good. I like how the series was able to include characters from most games including; Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Pokemon, Zelda, Metroid, Kid Icarus, and other minor games including Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, and Game and Watch. If smash 5 is created in the future it would make a great fifth game to an outstanding series. You may learn a lot more about this wonderful topic if you click the link below.</p>
